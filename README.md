# SaludHualqui

## Description
This project focuses on redesigning a website for a healthcare center, utilizing a pre-existing HTML template as a starting point. The objective was to create an updated and user-friendly website to organize and present information for a local health center. Through this mini-project, I was tasked with enhancing the website's design and content, while also optimizing its performance to ensure faster loading times and improved user experience.

*The language of the website is in Spanish.
