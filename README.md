# SaludHualqui

## Description
This is a simple website made by making minor changes to an HTML template, for a multimedia course.

The goal of this mini-project was that each student created one website to organize and display information of a local health center, some of which don't have a website or their version is outdated.

The language of the content is Spanish.
